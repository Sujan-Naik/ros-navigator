# ROS Navigator
*A house robot simulator built with ROS*

*A demo can be found here https://youtu.be/rrEhYljzPVI*

## What does it do ?
- A basic home-style robot that functions similarly to a roomba
- Utilises object detection using [YOLO] object detection
- and state machines using [SMACH](https://wiki.ros.org/smach) to perform complex behaviours in response to its surroundings
- Movement is controlled with the [move_base](https://wiki.ros.org/move_base) package
